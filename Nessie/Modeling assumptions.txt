Modeling assumptions 
(for rearranger)

- prob of a certain location of getting chosen for a rearrangement is determined according to the partition model (double-partition).

- partitions themselves - are their locations in the chromosome fixed, or do these areas' rearrangement probabilities "transfer" when they're rearranged?

After we determine where the rearrangement begins . . .

	+ prob(inversion when excising) = prob(no inversion)

	- uniformly distributed prob(re-insertion) (vs. junking the segment)
		- LIKELYHOOD_IO == LIKELYHOOD_KEEPING ~= LIKELYHOOD_EXCISION == ??????????? (can we estimate this? what's a best guess?)

	+ reinsertion location strongly dependent on original location - how?
		- simulation does NOT model this... 
		- determined according to original distribution, we choose NOT to model this accurately
	



NOTES

- median of 2 halves (partition data)

- rearrangements seem localized 

- rearrangements biased towards close-proximity, idk how much

- tandem repeats - hard to handle >2, do not model >2

- handle inplace inversions
